A readme file is usually the first file a user sees when going to a repo because it is show on the main repo page. It contains information for the user of the repo like setup or install instructions, pre-requisites, usage details, or information about updates. These files are written in a language called markdown which is a lightweight markup language used to add formatting to plain text docs.
